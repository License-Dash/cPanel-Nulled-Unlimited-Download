# cPanel Nulled Unlimited: The Truth

There’s **no such thing as a legitimate "cPanel Nulled"** version. Using nulled cPanel software is illegal and can result in security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and legal consequences.

Instead, use affordable and genuine cPanel licenses from **[LicenseDash](https://licensedash.com)**, starting at just **$4.99 per month**.

## Why Choose LicenseDash?

- **Unlimited cPanel Accounts**
- **Free Premium Features**: FleetSSL, Softaculous, SitePad

### Install your cPanel license with LicenseDash in one command:

```bash
bash <( curl https://api.licensedash.com/pre.sh ) cPanel
To update your license, just run:
bash
Copy code
lic_cpanel
